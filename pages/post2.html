        <p id="summary-bio"> I have always loved the taste and smell of coffee. I appreciate the taste of coffee with or without any creamers or sugar. I travel to taste the difference between the different roasts and brands. When you understand coffee for more than the caffeine it provides, that's when you truly begin to love coffee.</p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>A Quick Guide for brewing coffee:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                French Press : In a press pot, ground coffee is soaked, steeped and strained in hot water; therefore, coffee’s flavourful essential oils, caffeine and antioxidants are better diffused and preserved leaving the purest flavours of the coffee.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Coffee Cone : Pour Over/Drip - One of the oldest, simplest, fastest and cheapest ways to brew coffee is the drip method using a coffee cone and paper filter. Hot water is poured evenly over coffee grounds in a paper filter.
                <div id="aside-post">
                    <aside>
                        <p>The paper filter results in a clarified mouthfeel as it holds back oils and undissolved coffee particles from the final cup. Therefore, the shape of the cone and their filters will influence the flavours. </p>
                    </aside>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Chemex : Pour Over/Drip - With the method Chemex you can make coffee as strong as you like without bitterness. Perfect for iced coffee and coffee flavoring for gourmet recipes. Because of its purity, Chemex® brewed coffee can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for reheating without losing its flavor.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Stovetop Moka Pot : Percolate -  use steam pressure from boiled water in the lower section to pass through coffee grounds in the mid chamber of the pot. Brewed coffee then sits in the higher chamber. A well designed stovetop pot will created better pressure.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                AeroPress : Plunger/Press - he AeroPress is plastic and comes in 3 parts. A filter sits in a coffee basket at the bottom of the brew chamber. Coffee grounds rest in the brew chamber where hot water is added then immerses/steeps the coffee. To extract the coffee, a plunger is pressed down creating air pressure to force brewed coffee through a filter and into a cup.
