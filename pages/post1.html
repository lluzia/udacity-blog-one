                <p id="summary-bio"> I have always loved the taste and smell of coffee. I appreciate the taste of coffee with or without any creamers or sugar. I travel to taste the difference between the different roasts and brands. When you understand coffee for more than the caffeine it provides, that's when you truly begin to love coffee.</p>

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <h3><b>The legend</b></h3>
        <p>Here is a quote from Java Presse website:</p>
        <blockquote class="article-quote" cite="https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/buying-coffee/brief-history-of-coffee">
            Kaldi, an Ethiopian herdsman from Kaffa, was tending to his goats. He noticed that some of them were behaving abnorormally, jumping wildly and yelling. He realized that the energetic goats were eating small red berries.
            He tried one himself and felt energized quickly. He stuffed his pockets with some berries and took them to his wife, who counseled him to take the “heaven sent” berries to the nearby monastery.
            However, the monks were not so excited. They tossed the berries into the fire, believing them to be a trick of the Devil. However, as the seeds within roasted in the fire, the rich aromas caught the curiosity of the monks.
            They collected the roasted coffee beans from the fire, ground them into small pieces, and tossed them in some hot water. They tried the brew, and the rest is history.
            There’s no way to know how true this story is, or when exactly the events may have taken place (many estimate around 850 AD). But what’s the fun in a legend if the story can be proven?
            There are other origin tales, all centered around Ethiopia and Yemen, though this one is the most told and beloved.

        <h4>The cultivation</h4>
        <p class="article-text">Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula.  By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.
            Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many public coffee houses — called qahveh khaneh — which began to appear in cities across the Near East. The popularity of the coffee houses was unequaled and people frequented them for all kinds of social activity.
            Not only did the patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but they also listened to music, watched performers, played chess and kept current on the news.  Coffee houses quickly became such an important center for the exchange of information that they were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise.”
            With thousands of pilgrims visiting the holy city of Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby” began to spread. </p>
